# Biography

I currently am a PhD Candidate in Lab 17 (Psychometrics Chair) at Univeridad Autonoma de Madrid. I am interested on factor analysis and the application of psychometric models to high dimensional data. My latest projects include the development of new exploratory bi-factor analysis algorithms and the application of Bayesian estimation methods to these problems. 

I currently collaborate with several research groups, such as the [Policy Research Group](http://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/pol-res-group/people) - University of Cambridge (United Kingdom), at [Innovagog√≠a Research Group](https://innovagogia.jimdo.com/miembros/espa%C3%B1a-continuaci%C3%B3n/) - the Universidad Pablo Olavide (Seville, Spain). Produdly alumni of the [Junior Researcher Programme](http://jrp.pscholars.org/)!

I am open to new academic & non-academic projects, so feel free to contact me  with your proposal!
